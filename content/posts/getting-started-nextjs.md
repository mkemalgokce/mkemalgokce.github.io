# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of getting started with Next.js and learn about its key features.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several benefits out of the box:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and initial page load
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Fast page loads and reduced server costs
- **File-based Routing**: Intuitive and easy to understand
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints within your Next.js app
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Including CSS Modules and PostCSS

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new project with all the necessary dependencies and a basic file structure.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project includes:

- `pages/`: Your application pages and API routes
- `public/`: Static files like images
- `styles/`: Global styles and CSS modules
- `components/`: Reusable React components

## Basic Routing

Next.js uses file-based routing. For example:

- `pages/index.js` → `/`
- `pages/about.js` → `/about`
- `pages/blog/[slug].js` → `/blog/:slug`

## Conclusion

Next.js makes it easy to build modern web applications with React. Its intuitive features and excellent developer experience make it a great choice for your next project.
