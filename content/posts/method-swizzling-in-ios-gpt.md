# Method Swizzling in iOS: How, Why, and Testing Apple Frameworks

Method swizzling is a powerful yet controversial feature of Objective-C runtime that allows developers to dynamically replace the implementation of one method with another at runtime. While it’s often used to modify or extend the behavior of Apple’s frameworks, its misuse can lead to subtle and hard-to-diagnose bugs.

In this blog post, we’ll explore:

- What method swizzling is
- How and why to use it in iOS development
- Testing Apple frameworks using method swizzling
- Examples to demonstrate its application in Objective-C and Swift

## What is Method Swizzling?
Method swizzling is the process of exchanging the implementations of two methods at runtime. It relies on the Objective-C runtime, specifically the functions provided by the `objc/runtime.h` library.

In essence, swizzling allows you to intercept method calls and replace them with custom implementations. This can be incredibly useful for:

- Adding behavior to existing methods without subclassing
- Debugging or logging
- Mocking system frameworks for testing purposes

However, swizzling should always be approached with caution due to its potential side effects, such as breaking other parts of the codebase or introducing compatibility issues.

## How to Use Method Swizzling in iOS

To perform method swizzling, you need to:

1. Get the `Method` objects for the original method and the new method.
2. Swap their implementations using the `method_exchangeImplementations` function.

### Example: Adding Logging to View Controller Life Cycle in Objective-C

Here’s how you can add logging to `UIViewController`'s `viewDidLoad` method using method swizzling:

```objc
#import <objc/runtime.h>

@implementation UIViewController (Swizzling)

+ (void)load {
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
        Class class = [self class];

        SEL originalSelector = @selector(viewDidLoad);
        SEL swizzledSelector = @selector(swizzled_viewDidLoad);

        Method originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(class, originalSelector);
        Method swizzledMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(class, swizzledSelector);

        BOOL didAddMethod = class_addMethod(class,
                                            originalSelector,
                                            method_getImplementation(swizzledMethod),
                                            method_getTypeEncoding(swizzledMethod));

        if (didAddMethod) {
            class_replaceMethod(class,
                                swizzledSelector,
                                method_getImplementation(originalMethod),
                                method_getTypeEncoding(originalMethod));
        } else {
            method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, swizzledMethod);
        }
    });
}

- (void)swizzled_viewDidLoad {
    NSLog(@"View Did Load: %@", NSStringFromClass([self class]));
    [self swizzled_viewDidLoad]; // Calls the original implementation
}

@end
```

### Example: Adding Logging to View Controller Life Cycle in Swift

Using method swizzling in Swift is less common due to the lack of direct access to the Objective-C runtime, but it is still possible for classes exposed to Objective-C. Here’s how you can achieve the same result:

```swift
import UIKit
import ObjectiveC

extension UIViewController {
    static let swizzleViewDidLoad: Void = {
        let originalSelector = #selector(viewDidLoad)
        let swizzledSelector = #selector(swizzled_viewDidLoad)

        guard let originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(UIViewController.self, originalSelector),
              let swizzledMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(UIViewController.self, swizzledSelector) else { return }

        method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, swizzledMethod)
    }()

    @objc func swizzled_viewDidLoad() {
        print("View Did Load: \(type(of: self))")
        self.swizzled_viewDidLoad() // Calls the original implementation
    }
}

// Ensure swizzling occurs only once
extension AppDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        UIViewController.swizzleViewDidLoad
        return true
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The swizzling logic is triggered during the app launch, ensuring it is applied only once.
- The `swizzled_viewDidLoad` method adds custom behavior and then calls the original method.

### Real-World Examples of Method Swizzling

#### Adding Analytics Hooks
You can use swizzling to add analytics hooks to methods like `viewWillAppear` to automatically log screen views:

```swift
@objc func swizzled_viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    print("Screen view logged for: \(type(of: self))")
    self.swizzled_viewWillAppear(animated) // Calls the original implementation
}
```

#### Mocking URLSession for Network Testing
When testing network requests, you can swizzle `URLSession` to return mock responses:

```swift
extension URLSession {
    static let swizzleDataTask: Void = {
        let originalSelector = #selector(dataTask(with:completionHandler:))
        let swizzledSelector = #selector(mock_dataTask(with:completionHandler:))

        guard let originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(URLSession.self, originalSelector),
              let swizzledMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(URLSession.self, swizzledSelector) else { return }

        method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, swizzledMethod)
    }()

    @objc func mock_dataTask(with url: URL, completionHandler: @escaping (Data?, URLResponse?, Error?) -> Void) -> URLSessionDataTask {
        let mockData = "Mock response".data(using: .utf8)
        let mockResponse = HTTPURLResponse(url: url, statusCode: 200, httpVersion: nil, headerFields: nil)
        completionHandler(mockData, mockResponse, nil)
        return URLSessionDataTask()
    }
}

// Enable swizzling in tests
URLSession.swizzleDataTask
```

This allows you to test network code without relying on an actual server.

### Why Use Method Swizzling?

#### Pros:
- **Extend System Behavior:** Modify existing behavior in Apple’s frameworks without subclassing or rewriting large portions of code.
- **Centralized Logging/Analytics:** Automatically add analytics hooks to methods like `viewDidLoad` or `applicationDidEnterBackground`.
- **Mock Frameworks for Testing:** Replace specific framework methods with test-specific implementations.

#### Cons:
- **Fragility:** Swizzled methods may break in future OS updates if the underlying implementation changes.
- **Debugging Challenges:** Debugging swizzled code can be complex since method calls are redirected dynamically.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Other developers or libraries might also be swizzling the same methods, leading to unpredictable outcomes.

## Conclusion

Method swizzling is a powerful tool that allows iOS developers to customize and extend the behavior of Apple’s frameworks. While it can be incredibly useful for logging, analytics, and testing, it should be used sparingly and responsibly to avoid unintended consequences.

With great power comes great responsibility—use swizzling wisely and document its usage thoroughly to prevent surprises for your future self or your teammates!
